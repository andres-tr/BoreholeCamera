# Probe CAD

For the probe design it is desired to achieved the following:

 - Waterproof (1000m = 9.883MPa).
 - High temperature resistant (90ÂºC).
 - Low hydronynamic resistance to prevent vibrations while recording.
 - Mechanical design that allows it to stay centered inside the waterhole.

**Computer asisted desing so far**

**Note:** This first design doesn't consider proper dimensions for bolts, clamps, covers and the enclosure itself, its main function is to propose a solution.
